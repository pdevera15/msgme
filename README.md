## Project Overview
In the second half of 2023, I'm focusing on achieving a set of specific goals. These goals span personal, professional, and recreational areas of my life. To help me stay organized and motivated, I've created this repository to manage and track my progress.

## Tech Stack
- Spring Boot
- MongoDB Atlas
- Swagger (Future Integration)
- Still thinking for the stack for front-end, but most likely nextjs or astro.

Thank you for your interest in my Goal Management Repository, and I look forward to sharing my progress over the next six months!
